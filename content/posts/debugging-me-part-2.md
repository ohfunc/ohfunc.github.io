Welcome back to my Debugging Me series, where I review [Debugging Teams](http://debuggingteams.com) and dig into how it applies to myself. This is part 2, which focuses on team culture. If you haven't already, you might consider checking out [Part 1]({{< ref "debugging-me-part-1.md" >}}, "Part 1"), where I discussed the basic premise of the book (HRT) and how you might employ it better.

## Why do I need a team again?

While this question can sound silly at first, it makes some sense! If I can go hide in a cave and be productive by myself for hours at a time, emerging with a working product after a few days, why do we need a team at all? It turns out that teams can get more done while also increasing the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)! Sure, teams carry way more overhead, and communication can be annoying and difficult, but it's way less likely that you'll ship a product with a million lines of code by yourself, as opposed to with 30 of your peers.

Touching a bit on the bus factor -- you can see this anecdotally via open source projects. If someone works on a great project all on their own and then loses interest, there's not much hope for the project without just branching and moving on. 

So, if you're on a team, how do you actually.. uh.. you know, get things done?

## Engineering Without Direction


> A boat without a captain is nothing more than a floating waiting room—unless someone grabs the rudder and starts the engine, it’s just going to drift along aimlessly with the current. A project is just like that boat: if no one pilots it, you’re left with a group of geeks just sitting around waiting for something to happen. 

This is one of the metaphores in the book that has stuck with me the most, especially because I see a lot of (bad) similarities in the way I get work done. I often find myself with no goal at the beginning of the day and just flowing with what comes along. To be fair, this statement is talking about *projects*, not *individual contributions*, but there's still some points that can be shared between the two. Something I have and hope to continue to do is I start every day by writing down what I want to get done (employing many of the practices in [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)). This ensures that, even if it's not what I should be doing, at least I did it with some intention! I would recommend, and plan to, treating projects the same way. If you're passionate about something then push it! Be the captain of your boat, even if that just means moving the rudder by a few inches every day. 

What does moving that rudder actually look like? 

## Leading Teams

This section is, as you've probably noticed, titled "leading teams." Don't be fooled! This does or will apply to you! Keep in mind that teams often work on multiple *projects*, and each of those projects, as mentioned above, needs a captain. That captain can't (nor should it) always be the official "team lead", if you have one. I will continue to use "team" lead throughout this section, but I'd like you to imagine replacing each instance with "project lead" or even just "project contributor". 

The book has a **enormous** amount of helpful tips on how to effectively lead teams, starting with this gem: the most common thing a team leader does is **build consensus**. This can be as straightfoward as it sounds, in some cases -- you literally just get a bunch of people to agree on something. Sometimes this means steering the boat all day every day, and other times it means just giving the boat a little nudge here in there to keep it going the right direction.

Being a team lead also means helping to remove roadblocks for your project or team. Granted, you can't always remove the roadblocks yourself, but it's good to know at least *who* can help. This is one of those unfortunate situations in which "it's not what you know, but who you know" rings very true.

<!--
If you’re an engineer, it’s sometimes difficult to resist the urge to take a running leap into writing code for a new project, but this is rarely fruitful (unless you’re throwing together a quick and dirty prototype). Just the same, many engineers rush right into coding before designing the software they intend to write, and this usually ends very badly.


What we mean by "consensus" is that everyone has a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for the product’s success and that the leaders really listen to the team (with an emphasis on the "respect" component of HRT). This may mean there are times when extended discussion and reflection is what the product needs to succeed, and there are other times when the team agrees they need to move quickly. In the latter case, team members may decide to entrust a great deal of the nitty-gritty day-to-day decision making to one or more team leads.[12] In order for this to happen, the team as a whole needs to agree on the general mission of the team, and believe it or not, the key to that is the development of a team mission statement (more on that later in this chapter).

It’s possible to employ HRT here: be kind and empathetic when delivering constructive criticism without resorting to the compliment sandwich.

## Leading Teams

<!--

When a team member asks you for advice, it’s usually pretty exciting because you’re finally getting the chance to fix something! That’s exactly what you did for years before moving into a leadership position, so you usually go leaping into solution mode, but that is the last place you should be. The person asking for advice typically doesn’t want you to solve her problem, but rather to help her solve it, and the easiest way to do this is to ask her questions.

Individual successes and failures are a bit different. It’s one thing to laud individual successes, but looking to assign individual blame in the case of failure is a great way to divide a team and discourage risk taking across the board. It’s OK to fail, but fail as a team and learn from your failures. If an individual succeeds, praise him in front of the team. If an individual fails, give constructive criticism in private.

One of the hardest things to do as a team leader is to watch a more junior-level team member spend three hours working on something you know you can knock out in 20 minutes. Teaching people and giving them a chance to learn on their own can be incredibly difficult at first, but it’s a vital component of effective leadership. 

The last thing is probably the most important—giving your mentee enough information is what you’re supposed to be doing, but if you overexplain things or ramble on endlessly, your mentee will probably tune you out rather than politely tell you she got it.

The best leaders we’ve worked with have all been amateur psychologists, looking in on their team members' welfare from time to time, making sure they get recognition for what they do, and trying to make certain they are happy with their work. 

One of the most valuable tools in tracking your team’s happiness is, at the end of each one-on-one meeting, to ask the team member, "What do you need?" 

If you ask a team member where she sees her career in five years, most of the time you’ll get a shrug and a blank look. When put on the spot, most people won’t say much about this, but there are usually a few things that everyone would like to do in the next five years: get promoted, learn something new, launch something important, and work with smart people. Regardless of whether they verbalize this, most people are thinking about it. If you’re going to be an effective leader, you should be thinking about how you can help make all those things happen and let your team know you’re thinking about this.

Seek to replace yourself.

Delegate, but get your hands dirty.

Shield your team from chaos.

Know when to make waves.

To frame this in the context of HRT: if the manager makes it obvious that she trusts her employee, the employee feels positive pressure to live up to that trust. 

Try to appreciate inquiry: when someone questions a decision or statement you made, remember that this person is usually just trying to better understand you. If you encourage inquiry, you’re much more likely to get the kind of constructive criticism that will make you a better leader of a better team.

## Effective Team Culture

<!--
A good general rule around communication is to include as few people as necessary in synchronous communication (like meetings and phone calls), and to go for a broader audience in asynchronous communication (like email, issue trackers, and document comments). 

Let’s start with the most dreaded meeting of all: the standing meeting. This meeting usually takes place every week, and should absolutely be kept to basic announcements and introductions—going around the room for a status update from every attendee (whether they have something important to add or not) is a recipe for wasted time, rolling eyes, and a burning desire to punch yourself in the throat just to make it end.

 you’re going to have a meeting, create an agenda and distribute it to all attendees at least a day before the meeting so that they’ll know what to expect. Invite as few people as possible (remember the cost of synchronous communication). We know team members, managers, and even directors and VPs who will flat out ignore invitations to a meeting that has no agenda.

 Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, while leaders worry about what things get done…(and trust their team to figure out how to do it).

TL (tech lead) and TLM (tech lead manager).[30] A TL is typically responsible for the technical direction for all (or part) of a product, while a TLM is responsible for the technical direction for all (or part) of a product in addition to the careers and happiness of the people on the team. 

"Above all, resist the urge to manage." 

It’s never any fun to pull teeth. We’ve seen team leaders do all the right things to build incredibly strong teams, only to have these teams fail to excel (and eventually fall apart) because of just one or two low performers. We understand that the human aspect is the hardest part of writing software, but the hardest part of dealing with humans is handling someone who isn’t meeting expectations. Sometimes people miss expectations because they’re not working long enough or hard enough, but the most difficult cases are when someone just isn’t capable of doing his job no matter how long or hard he works.

As an engineer, you likely developed an excellent sense of skepticism and cynicism, but this can be a liability when you’re trying to lead a team. That’s not to say you should be naïvely optimistic at every turn, but you would do well to be less vocally skeptical while still letting your team know you’re aware of the intricacies and obstacles involved in your work.

Fitz used to joke that if someone came in and told Bill 19 of the company’s offices had been attacked by spaaaaaace aliens, Bill’s response would be, "Any idea why they didn’t make it an even 20?"

A common saying at Google is that if you try to achieve an impossible goal, there’s a good chance you’ll fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you’ll most likely accomplish way more than you would have accomplished had you merely attempted something you knew you could complete. A good way to build a culture where risk taking is accepted is to let your team know it’s OK to fail.

## Helping Team Members

<!--

How does one coach a low performer effectively? It turns out that the two of us have (unfortunately) had quite a lot of experience in this area, gained through painful trial and error. The best analogy is to imagine you’re helping a limping person learn to walk again, then jog, then run alongside the rest of the team. It almost always requires temporary micromanagement—but still a whole lot of HRT, particularly respect.

To get all of your team members into the sweet spot, you need to motivate the ones who fall into the "In a rut" portion of the matrix, and provide stronger direction to those who are in the "Look! Squirrel!" portion. Of course, those who are "adrift" need both motivation and direction. So, instead of water and sunlight, you need to provide team members with a combination of motivation and direction to make them happy and productive. And you don’t want to give them too much of either—because if they don’t need motivation or direction and you try giving it to them, you’re just going to annoy them.

There are two types of motivation: extrinsic, which originates from outside horses (such as monetary compensation), and intrinsic, which comes from within. In his book Drive,[38] Dan Pink explains that the way to make people the happiest and most productive isn’t to motivate them extrinsically (e.g., throw piles of cash at them), but rather to work to increase their intrinsic motivation. Dan claims you can increase intrinsic motivation by giving people three things: autonomy, mastery, and purpose

## Helping Yourself

<!--
Pursue extra responsibility as you’re getting your work done.

Take risks and don’t fear failure

Question things that you’re unsure about

Your manager is not clairvoyant: only rarely will you find a person in an organization who overcommunicates, so don’t hesitate to update your team’s leader on what you’re doing before she asks you what’s going on.

Much like the sparring program, companies are made of rules: some of them can be bent, and others can be broken. If you focus on the way things should be in your organization, you’ll usually find nothing but frustration and disappointment. Instead, acknowledge the way things are, and focus on navigating your organization’s structure to find the mechanisms you can use to get things done and to carve out a happy place for yourself in your company.  

It’s Easier to Ask for Forgiveness Than Permission"

By this we mean you need to try to ensure that both your manager and the people outside your team are not only aware of what you’re doing, but are aware that you’re doing it well. Some people find this mode of "selling yourself" distasteful, and it may remain so, but the benefits of doing this are huge.

We recommend that you focus your energies on launching products over just about everything else. 

lucky people "are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities." We think the same tenet applies to creating opportunities in companies: if you perform your job to the letter of the law and focus only on getting your own work done to the exclusion of all else, there will be few chance opportunities for you. If you help others get their jobs done when given the chance, even when it’s not part of your job, there’s no guarantee (nor should there be a "tit for tat" expectation) that they’ll return the favor, but many people will gladly repay the favor in the future if given the chance.

Keep track of your accomplishments and use them in your self-assessment. Update your résumé[56] and share it with your manager or promotion committee. Read up on the promotion process and talk to your manager about what boxes you need to tick off to get promoted, and methodically work to tick off every box. Even if getting promoted is subjective and nondeterministic, there’s a lot you can do to increase the odds in your favor.

We call this the "Three Bullets and a Call to Action" technique, and it will drastically increase your chances of getting action—or at the very least, a response—from just about anyone you email out of the blue asking for something,[58] not just an executive.

Do the right thing, wait to get fired
