      <description>I recently read over Debugging Teams at the suggestion of one of my mentors, and wanted a place to dump my thoughts on the book. This is that place. The content here is fairly personal, with most of the things revolving around me, but hopefully they may serve some use to others as well. So, without further ado let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the content of the book. This first part covers HRT, the main theme of the book.</description>
